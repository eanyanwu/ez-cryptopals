//! Break repeating-key XOR
//!
//! This one is actually reeeallly interesting and, dare I say it? FUN?
//! 
//! Disclaimer, since the challenge basically outlined the steps for solving this one, I did not feel 
//! it cheating to look up more about the repeating XOR cipher (also called the VigenÃ¨re cipher).
//! Doing so was helpful because it explained the reasoning behind the solution which i think is more fun than the solution itself.
//! 
//! The repeating XOR cipher was created as a response to the fact that the single character cipher (also called Caesar ciphers) could be 
//! broken by "frequency analysis". This is what we did earlier when we were "scoring" byte sequences. 
//! By using a repeating XOR pattern, the cipher text counterpart of a plain text character won't show up with the same frequency (if that makes sense)
//! 
//! HOWEVER. The weakness of the repeating XOR cipher is in its repeating nature. If an attacker (me) guesses the key length, they can treat the cipher
//! as "interwoven" Caesar ciphers, which can be broken individually individually using frequency analysis
//! 
//! The hard part is guessing the key. The challenge suggests that we can do so by comparing the edit distance between 2 KEYSIZE_GUESS blocks. The guess 
//! with the lowest disstance is probably the key. This _kinda_ makes sense in a vague sort of way. If two blocks were XORed by the same key, their edit
//! distance would be lower than if the were not? It's not intuitive, but I _could_ see how that is the case...maybe
